My first Choose Your Own Adventure Project!

As a newbie to the software development world, I've been trying my hand at some basic Java-based projects. 
My first-ever side project is a Choose Your Own Adventure game, which utilizes scanners to capture your inputs. 
Once inputs are received, users will receive the next section of the saga, and will have to try to maneuver their way through the tale. 

This project is still a work in progress, but I wanted to push what I have completed so far!
Thank you for viewing, and if you have any comments, please let me know!
